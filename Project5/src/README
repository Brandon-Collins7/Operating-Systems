Separate compilation is demonstrated using the following multiple source code files.
The following eight (8) source code files are used:

(1) open.h
(2) open.cpp
(3) read.h
(4) read.cpp
(5) stats.h
(6) stats.cpp
(7) scheduler.h
(8) scheduler.cpp

How to manually compile the above multiple source code files?
$gcc -c open.cpp
$gcc -c read.cpp
$gcc -c stats.cpp
$gcc open.o read.o stats.o scheduler.cpp -o scheduler

How to run the executable file - scheduler?
$./scheduler <file_name> [FCFS|RR|SRTF] [time_quantum]

How to compile using the Makefile?
$make
